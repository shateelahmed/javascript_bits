        // Third Greatest
        // Have the function ThirdGreatest(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr and return the third largest word within it. So for example: if strArr is ["hello", "world", "before", "all"] your output should be world because "before" is 6 letters long, and "hello" and "world" are both 5, but the output should be world because it appeared as the last 5 letter word in the array. If strArr was ["hello", "world", "after", "all"] the output should be after because the first three words are all 5 letters long, so return the last one. The array will have at least three strings and each string will only contain letters.

        function compare(a, b) {
            if ( a.word_length > b.word_length ) {
                return -1;
            } else if ( a.word_length < b.word_length ) {
                return 1;
            }
            return 0;
        }
        
        function ThirdGreatest(strArr) {
            words_with_length = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < strArr.length; i++) {
                word_with_length = {
                    word: strArr[i],
                    word_length: strArr[i].length,
                }
                words_with_length.push(word_with_length);
            }

            words_with_length.sort(compare);
            return words_with_length[2].word;
        }

        console.log(ThirdGreatest(["hello", "world", "before", "all"]));
        console.log(ThirdGreatest(["hello", "world", "after", "all"]));
        console.log(ThirdGreatest(["coder","byte","code"]));
